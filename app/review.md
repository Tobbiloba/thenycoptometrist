Dr. Joanna Latek was fabulous!! So kind and calming. I've never had such great bedside manner and she helped me figure out how to give my eyes a break since I have such a high prescription! She is also so professional. The front staff are so kind and helpful as well. All nice ladies and helped me find a pair of glasses that fit my face best .l believe her name was Sylvia !

A fantastic experience was had with Dr. Joanna and the team ! The front desk staff was friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an excellent eye doctor!.

Dr. Latek really took her time to figure out my prescription after many failed attempts with previous providers. I finally have contacts that don't bother my eyes anymore. Definitely my new doctor!

Dr Latek took the time to explain why I developed the problem that I had and what she was going to do to help me! I never thought I could achieve 20/20 but with her recommendations and treatment plan, I am confident I will be there soon. No other doctor in the past has ever explained my condition to me so thoroughly and now I whole-heartedly feel that I am part of my own treatment... show more

Dr. Latek took the time to walk me through my first eye exam and sent me home with extra materials for my case. I appreciate that she took the extra time to explain what tools she was using and what she was looking for. I would recommend doctor Latek to anyone looking for the best in eye care in the city. I look forward to my follow up with her.
